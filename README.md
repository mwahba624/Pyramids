# Portfolio

## Descrition
* For this assignment I have HTML and CSS for a sample protifolio. This will be useful for future jobs to show our skills in Web Development. 

## Use Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Task Completed
* The site is broken up into multiple categories, such as Contact information, Work, and About Me.
* The page was designed to fit a variety of screen sizes and included some hover effects. 
* At the top of the page, I have functional navigation buttons that direct users to each section. 
* I have included a link to my Resume.
* I have attached  picture of me.
* I have attached some placeholder pictures for current and future assignments. I will add them once I finish with them.
* I added some comments to both HTML and CSS.
